Security Metrics Types
    Process Security Metrics
    Network Security Metrics
    Software Security Metrics   <<
        Software measures are troublesome (LOC, FPs, Complexity etc)
        “Laws of Physics” are missing
        Metrics are context sensitive and environment-dependent
        Architecture dependent
        Aggregation may not lead to strength
        
        Size and complexity
        Defects/LOC
        Defects (severity, type) over time
        Cost per defect
        Attack surface (# of interfaces)
        Layers of security
        Design Flaws
