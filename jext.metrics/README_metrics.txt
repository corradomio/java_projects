1) to classify the metrics in different categories
2) each tool has different set of metrics
3) to retrieve
    3.1) a single metric to a single component
    3.2) all metrics belonging to a category to a single component
    3.3) all metrics belonging to a category to all components of a specified type

Security Metrics Types
    Process Security Metrics
    Network Security Metrics
    Software Security Metrics   <<
        Software measures are troublesome (LOC, FPs, Complexity etc)
        “Laws of Physics” are missing
        Metrics are context sensitive and environment-dependent
        Architecture dependent
        Aggregation may not lead to strength
        
        Size and complexity
        Defects/LOC
        Defects (severity, type) over time
        Cost per defect
        Attack surface (# of interfaces)
        Layers of security
        Design Flaws
